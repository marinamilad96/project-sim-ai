    "In this chapter, we define the length of a path in a tree as the sum of the lengths of its edges (rather than the number of edges on the path). As a result, the evolutionary distance between two present-day species corresponding to leaves i and j in a tree T is equal to the length of the unique path connecting i and j, denoted di,j(T).\n",
